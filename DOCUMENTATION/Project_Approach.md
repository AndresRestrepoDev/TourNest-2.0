# Project Document: Hotel and Package Tour Management System (TourNest)

---

## 1. Problem

Currently, many hotels that also offer package tours manage their operations in a fragmented manner:

* One system (or even manual logs) for rooms.
* Another separate system for excursions, tours, or package tours.

This creates multiple difficulties:

* **Overbooking**: duplicate reservations for the same room or tour.
* **Loss of information**: difficulty unifying customer and payment data.
* **Inefficient promotion management**: inability to easily offer combined packages (hotel + tour).
* **Lack of control** over reporting, finance, and administration.

---

## 2. Solution

Develop a **unified web platform** that centralizes hotel and tourism management, enabling:

* Room reservations with real-time availability.
* Sales of package tours associated with hotel reservations.
* Centralized control of payments, customers, and reports.
* Access for different roles: administrator, receptionist, and client.

---

## 3. Target Audience

* **Small and medium-sized hotels** that currently do not have a unified system.
* **Local travel agencies** looking to integrate packages with accommodations.
* **Traveling clients** looking to book rooms and tours in one place, easily and securely.

---

## 4. General Scope

The system will cover the following areas:

* **Administrative management**: rooms, packages, activities.
* **Customer management**: user registration, reservation history.
* **Online booking**: rooms and tour packages with real-time availability.
* **Automated communication**: confirmation emails, reminders, and notifications.
* **Differentiated roles**: administrator, receptionist, and client.

    * Tour package registration and management.
* **Customer**:
