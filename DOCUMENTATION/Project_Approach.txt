Project Document: Hotel and Tour Package Management System (TourNest)

1. Problem

Currently, many hotels that also offer tour packages manage their operations in a fragmented way:

One system (or even manual records in notebooks) for rooms. Another separate system for excursions, tours, or tour packages. This generates multiple difficulties:

Overbooking: duplicate reservations for the same room or tour.
Loss of information: difficulty unifying customer and payment data.
Inefficient promotion management: unable to easily offer combined packages (hotel + tour).
Lack of control in reports, finances, and administration.

2. Solution

Develop a unified web platform that centralizes hotel and tourism management, allowing:

Room reservations with real-time availability, sale of tour packages associated with hotel bookings, centralized control of payments, customers, and reports, access for different roles: administrator, receptionist, and client.

3. Added Value with AI ðŸ¤–

The system will integrate Artificial Intelligence tools to improve experience and management:

Personalized recommendations: suggest tour packages based on reservation history or customer preferences.
Occupancy prediction: estimate hotel occupancy levels for future dates to adjust dynamic pricing.
Intelligent chatbot: automated customer service for common queries (availability, prices, check-in/out).
Trend analysis: automatic reports identifying the most popular tours or peak demand seasons.

4. Target Audience

- Small and medium hotels that currently do not have a unified system.
- Local travel agencies that want to integrate packages with accommodation.
- Traveler clients looking to book room + tour in one place, easily and securely.

5. General Scope

The system will cover the following areas:

- Administrative management: rooms, packages, financial reports.
- Customer management: user registration, reservation history, payment control.
- Online reservations: rooms and tour packages with real-time availability.
- Automated communication: confirmation emails, reminders, and notifications.
- Differentiated roles: administrator, receptionist, and client.

6. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The MVP will include the following functionalities:

Administrator: Registration and management of rooms (type, price, capacity), registration and management of tour packages, basic payment control, and generation of simple reports.

Client: User registration, search for available rooms by date, online booking, selection of an additional tour package, consultation of reservation and payment status.

MVP AI Extras (minimum):

Simple chatbot for frequently asked questions.
Initial package recommendation based on room selection.
